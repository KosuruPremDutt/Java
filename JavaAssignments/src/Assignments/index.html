      <u><b>Thousands of people along the coast there fled for higher ground</b></u> as waves of 1.2m hit Oahu, and even larger ones of 1.7m
      struck Maui. Governor <em>Josh Green</em> did not hold back when he warned residents: "It is not a regular wave. It will actually kill
      you if you get hit by a tsunami." However, a few hours later he reported that: "So far we have not seen a wave of consequence." The
      tsunami warning for Hawaii was downgraded to an advisory level by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC), meaning there is the
      potential for strong waves, currents and minor flooding, but a major tsunami is no longer expected. The Hawaii Emergency Management
      Agency director, Stephen Logan, later said those evacuated could return home but urged people to be careful, drive slowly, and watch
      for flooding. Why did Russian mega earthquake not cause more tsunami damage? Tsunami warnings downgraded as threat to North America
